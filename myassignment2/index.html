		<p> North Carolina is growing. The state offers newcomers plentiful employment and educational opportunities, and boasts an attractive geographic diversity of coastlines and rolling mountains. Renting there, however, is an increasing challenge. </p>

		<p> Half of all renters in the United States are cost-burdened, meaning they pay more than 30% of their income on rent costs. North Carolina, which has historically been slightly below this threshold, is catching up. According to 5-year data from the <a href="https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDP5Y2022.DP04?q=DP04:%20SELECTED%20HOUSING%20CHARACTERISTICS&g=010XX00US_040XX00US37,37$0500000&moe=false">2022 American Community Survey</a>, 48% of North Carolina renters now qualify as cost-burdened. </p>

		<p>The top five counties with the highest proportion of cost-burdened rental households include Hyde, Watauga, Washington, Hertford and Currituck. More than 57% of the renters in these counties are paying a large chunk of their incomes on housing – often at the cost of other living expenses like groceries and health care. Four out of the five counties – Hyde, Washington, Hertford and Currituck – are concentrated along the state's coastal plains. </p>

		<p>Coastal counties' limited housing stocks – which are expensive to maintain and difficult to protect from increasingly frequent hurricanes – were further depleted <a href="https://carolinapublicpress.org/62406/habitat-nc-affordable-homes-obstacles/">during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, when retirees and remote workers fled larger cities for the scenic coastal life.</p>

		<p>Similar spikes in rental property cost and demand were <a href="https://theappalachianonline.com/rental-rush-creates-high-country-housing-troubles/">felt in the state's high country</a>, including Watauga and Buncombe. Watauga County, located in the state's mountainous western region, is home to Appalachian State University. There, the need for student housing puts further stress on a limited housing supply and a historically poor economy.</p>

		<p>Other large universities, like UNC-Chapel Hill and UNC-Wilmington, add stress to their respective counties – Orange and New Hanover – where the cost-burdened population exceeds the national average.</p>

		<p>There is currently no county in North Carolina in which a minimum wage job could cover a 2-bedroom apartment. <a href="https://nlihc.org/housing-needs-by-state">The National Low Income Housing Coalition</a> calculates a per-county "housing wage," the minimum hourly wage needed for a resident of that county to afford a 2-bedroom apartment. The lowest housing wage in North Carolina is found in Wilkes County, at $14.83 – more than double the federal minimum wage. On the highest end is Buncombe County, at $28.19.</p>

		<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nchfa.com/who-experiencing-housing-cost-burden-north-carolina">North Carolina Housing Finance Agency</a>, 30% of residents are renters. Across the state, governments and organizations are endeavoring to assist this population with affordable housing initiatives, voucher programs, community land trusts and tenant protection groups. But the state has a long way to go before its rental market can adequately meet the needs – and means – of its residents.</p>
